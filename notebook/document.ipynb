    "    Key Concepts in Machine Learning:\n",

    "    3. Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment.\n",
    "       They receive feedback in the form of rewards or penalties and aim to maximize cumulative rewards over time.\n",
